[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findtrajectroy_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "trajectroy_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "trajectroy_msgs"
  with any of the following names:

    trajectroy_msgsConfig.cmake
    trajectroy_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "trajectroy_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "trajectroy_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "trajectroy_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
